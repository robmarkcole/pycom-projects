# pycom-projects
* Micropython mini projects with pycom boards for demos/education.
* The `main.py` (and any supporting libraries) can be uploaded to the pycom board using [Filezilla](https://docs.pycom.io/gettingstarted/programming/ftp#filezilla).  
* I am using the pymakr plugin for [VScode]https://docs.pycom.io/pymakr/installation/vscode/ to access the REPL and edit my code.
