# pycom-projects
* Micropython mini projects with pycom boards for demos/education.
* When flashing the board firmware [use pybytes to configure the wifi credentials](https://docs.pycom.io/pybytes/connect/quick/). BE SURE TO FORCE PYBYTES REGISTRATION
* I am using the pymakr plugin for [VScode]https://docs.pycom.io/pymakr/installation/vscode/ to access the REPL and edit my code. Allows upload and download of files, access to REPL and can run files on the board
* When the board starts up it will always run `boot.py`, then `main.py`
